## Usage
This application should allow users to easily generate a random password. First the app prompts the user with a variety of criteria that the user may want in their password. It then creates a random password that is between 8 and 128 characters long from the critera selected. If a user accidentally enters in a password length that is not a number or does not choose any criteria for the password to be chosen from the site re-prompts the user to enter the information. The user will be able to clear an old password and generate a new passowrd by re-pressing the "Generate Password" button.
